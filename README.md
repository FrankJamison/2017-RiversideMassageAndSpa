# Riverside Massage & Spa (Course Project)

Static multi-page website for a fictional massage and spa business. Built as part of **SNHU IT-649 (Interface Design for Web)** and implemented with **HTML + CSS**.

## What’s Included

- A small marketing site with multiple service pages
- A staff page
- A scheduling page (form-based)
- A contact page (form-based)

## Pages

- `index.html` — Home / landing page
- `services.html` — Services overview
- `massage.html` — Massage services
- `facial.html` — Facial services
- `brenda.html` — Individual/staff profile page
- `rolita.html` — Individual/staff profile page
- `staff.html` — Staff listing
- `scheduling.html` — Scheduling form
- `contact.html` — Contact form

## How To Preview

You can view the site directly in a browser.

1. Open `index.html`.
2. Navigate using the site’s header/navigation links.

If your browser restricts any local file behaviors, run a simple local web server of your choice (any basic server works) and then open `index.html` through that server.

## Editing & Customization

- **Content**: Update text directly in the HTML files.
- **Navigation**: If you rename pages, update the corresponding `<a href="...">` links across the site.
- **Styling**: The site uses a custom stylesheet; edit it to adjust layout, typography, spacing, and colors.
- **Forms**: The scheduling and contact forms are front-end only unless you wire them to a backend (no server-side handler is included here).

## Notes / Constraints

- This is a course/portfolio project intended for UI and layout practice.
- No build step, package manager, or framework is required.

## Suggested Workflow (VS Code)

- Open the folder in VS Code.
- Make changes to an HTML page and refresh the browser to see updates.
